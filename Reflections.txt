How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It reduced the number of lines to scan to those with the greatest 
liklihood of holding the offensive code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can go back to old projects and re-use code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It is nice to have the control to decide when to commit, but it is infuriating 
to make a lot of "progress" and get so caught up in the code that you do not realize 
you should have committed when it is suddenly too late.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is exponentially more complex to keep track of multiple documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will allow me to view the version history, id, author, description 
of each commit, while git diff will allow me to compare 2 versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is like having an undo button. You feel confident that you can always go 
back to that magical moment when everything compiled. It frees you to take more risks.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Hmmm I don't know yet
